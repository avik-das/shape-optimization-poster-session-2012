Objective:
 - Minimize energy of a curve based on bending and twisting
 - Invert a torus in minimal energy fashion

Bending and twist:
 - PICT: twist (uncompensated)
 - PICT: twist (  compensated)
 - unfolding torus
   - PICT: figure-8 <- point out more bending
   - PICT: unfolded <- point out more twist
   - middle ground?

== MIDDLE COLUMN: =============================================================

Torus eversion:
 - PICT: from video
   - two Klein bottle mouths
 - PICT: red/green wire mesh

Symmetric halfway-point
 - model
 - PICT: symmetric-halfway point
   - additionally, wireframe and just the runner

Towards eversion
 - PICT: straightening out one arm
 - PICT: moving the end caps closer together (270 degrees perhaps?)
 - PICT: 360 degrees of twist on right arm

== RIGHT COLUMN: ==============================================================

Implementation details
 - gradient descent
 - one parameter at a time <- local minima
 - one of the following:
   - PICT: double circle
   - PICT: trefoil

Future work:
 - gridded optimization
   - PICT: bending based on quadrilateral patches
   - PICT: twisting based on quadrilateral patches
   - many parameters
